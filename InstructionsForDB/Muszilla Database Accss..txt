How to Connect to Muszilla Azure Database.
Since the project is being hosted on a cloud server, all you have to do is run the VS file and the program should run.

If you want to acess the database itself to see the raw data you will first need to dowload Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

Once downloaded, when prompted to connect to a server enter these onto the the respective fields:

Server Type: Database Engine
Server Name: muzilla2.database.windows.net
Authentication: SQL Server Authentication
Login: muzilla
Password: AleMazNat1

Hit Connect and you will have access to all the raw data currently contained in the database!
*Keep in mind that if you choose to connect to the cloud server it might take multiple tries for the connection to establish*

If for some reason the connectio to the Azure server fails, I have attached the schema to create the tables on your local database server.
If you haven't already dowloaded MSQLSM do so. Open up your local database server and either open the given query or copy paster the query on to a new one on the database.
Then on the main VS file click on the Resources.rex file and change the string with name ConnectionString to:

Server=YourServerHere;Database=YourDatabaseNameHere;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True

If your database uses a user name and password:

Server=YourServerHere;Database=YourDatabaseNameHere;User ID=YourUserName;Password=YourPassword;;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True

This should connect the VS file the local instance you made; keep in mind all tables will be empty.
